# Suriyakras

**Suriyakaras** (สุริยคราส) is a Thai word for a *solar eclipse*. We chose this name because total solar eclipses are prbably the most beautiful thing humans can see with our naked eyes. 

Additionally, this year (2018) is also the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the **King of Siam's Solar Eclipse**, the eclipse which *King Mongkut* of Siam, also the *Father of Science in Thailand*, calculated two years in advance. The result of the calculation is *accurate* to the location of the observation. We also want to honour him.
